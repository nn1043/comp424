comp424_02042020.py - This program demonstrates how string manipulation works in Python. User is allowed to add and remove 
their own sequences. The examples currently supported are join(), split(), upper(), and lower(). In-line documentation is
completed. The code is in regulation with pycodestyle.

user_interface.py - This program is an improvement on my task_manager() function, which is used as a text-based user interface. The goal is to preserve code lines while improving programmer functionality. Will be used as my standard UI for all text-based Python programs. No in-line documentation exists. The code is in regulation with pycodestyle.

read_write_demo.py - This program serves as practice with reading and writing text files in Python. This program utilizes 1.txt and 2.txt. No in-line documentation exists. The code is in regulation with pycodestyle.

RPG.py - This program aims to create a basic command-line interface, text-based, role-playing game. It will take advantage of Python read and write functions to create 'saved data.' This project is intended to take a longer period of time to complete.

long_short_spread.py - This program is designed to aid me in quickly calculating equal value long/short spreads for use in stock trading. Using a relative price and hedge amount as entered by the user, the program returns the required number of shares to purchase for all prices +/- $1.00 of the entered price. As I am the intended user, there are no exception handlers. Some in-line documentation exists. The code is in regulation with pycodestyle.
