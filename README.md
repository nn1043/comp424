# comp424
comp424_02042020.py - This program demonstrates how string manipulation works in Python. User is allowed to add and remove 
their own sequences. The examples currently supported are join(), split(), upper(), and lower(). In-line documentation is
completed. The code is in regulation with pycodestyle.

user_interface.py - This program is a work-in-progress improvement on my task_manager() function, which is used as a text-based user interface. The goal is to preserve code lines while improving programmer functionality. Will be implemented into the next major project once completed.
